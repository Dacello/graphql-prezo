### *for dummies*

---

# What is GraphQL
- Stands for "Graph Query Language"
- An API specification invented by Facebook
- An efficient and flexible alternative to REST
- Enables declarative data fetching

---

# REST API Endpoints
<img width='100%' src='./rest.png' />

---

# REST - Shortcomings
- Over/under fetching of data
- Each endpoint is structured according to clients needs
- Less flexible when client needs change <br />(or differ accross multiple clients)
- Many UI change will likely require server changes

---

GraphQL was developed to cope with the need for more flexibility and efficiency in client-server communication

---

# GraphQL - Advantages
- Client requests precisely what data it wants
- No over/under fetching of data
- One endpoint to rule them all
- Minimizes the data transfered over the network
- Flexibility allows for rapid product iteration 
- Strongly typed Schema
- Can be used to unify existing systems and hide complexity of data fetching logic

---

# Schema
- Defines the structure and capabilites of the API
- A collection of GraphQL Types
- Serves as a contract between client and server

```
type Author {
  id: String!
  name: String
  books: [Book]
}
```

```
type Book {
  id: String!
  name: String
  author: Author
}
```

---

# Queries
- How the client requests information from a GraphQL server
- Can request as much or as little information as necessary
- Allows for naturally querying nested information
- All possible queries are defined by the Schema

---

# Example Query Request
```
{
	books {
		name
		genre
		author{
			name
			books{
				name
			}
		}
	}
}
```

---

# Example Query Response
```
{
	"books": [
		{
			"name": "Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone",
			"genre": "Fantasy
			"author": {
				"name": "J.K. Rowling"
				"books": [
					{
						"name": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
					},
					{
						"name": "Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban"
					},
					{
						"name": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"
					},
					...
				]
			}
		}
		...
	]
}
```
---

# Mutations
- How to make changes to your data (create/update/delete)
- Similar syntax to queries
- All possible mutations are defined by the Schema

---

# Example Mutation Request

```
mutation {
	addBook(
		name: "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince",
		authorId: "1",
		genre: "Fantasy"
	) {
		name
	}
}
```

---

# Example Mutation Response
```
{
  "data": {
    "addBook": {
      "name": "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Resolvers
- each resolver fetches data for a given field
- queries/mutations consist of a set of fields
- the server has one resolver function per field

---

# Resolver Example
Query:
```
{
	books {
		name
		genre
		author{
			name
		}
	}
}
```

# Apollo
- [Apollo Client (React)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - a community-driven effort to build an easy-to-understand, flexible and powerful GraphQL client. 
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) - the best way to quickly build a production-ready, self-documenting API for GraphQL clients, using data from any source.
